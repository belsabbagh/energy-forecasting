# Notes

## Stuff to do

- Calculate correlation between different energy consumptions and productions for each country.
  - To prove that there is a relationship between the different energy sources.
- Forecast energy consumption and production for each country.
  - Calculate forecasting errors and stuff.

## Introduction

The last 30 years have seen great changes in how the world uses and produces energy. Not only does the world produce more energy because of the increasing demand, but also the world is starting to vary its energy sources and moving to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. With our knowledge of how energy production and consumption changed over the last 30 years, we want to forecast what the future for energy may look like. In this paper, we will be forecasting energy consumption and production for different countries using different models and comparing their performance. This study should distinguish the differnet forecasting models and their performance on different datasets.
