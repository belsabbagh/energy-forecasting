### Summary

Scientists from the University of Singapore reviewed different methods of time-series forecasting for energy consumption in buildings. They collected some of the most promising methods that other researchers have come up with and studied them comparatively in terms of individual advantages and disadvantages and in terms of performance given the problem at hand. Moreover, they deeply reviewed the use of hybrid models that combine two or more forecasting techniques. They overviewed all models and reviewed the best papers that presented these models. They applied those models to different datasets and compared their performance. They concluded that hybrid models outperform single models when comparing mean absolute percentage error.

### Personal Notes

- This study is almost relevant given context but it is not exactly what we are looking for. It is more focused on forecasting energy consumption in buildings rather than forecasting energy consumption and production in countries.

### Summary

Researchers from Idaho State University, University of Connecticut, and the Villanova Center for Resilient Water Systems developed a scheme to predict power consumption and renewable energy production using a recurrent neural network. They explored the nature of the relationship between annual power consumption and total renewable energy production through extensive analysis and feature engineering. They acquired the Open Power System data for germany due to the significant rise of use of renewable energy in the country. The data spanned a decade with daily resolution. They were able to forecast up to eleven years ahead with a root mean squared error of 0.084. They concluded that recurrent neural networks have a lot of potential to improve performance on time series forecasting since they claim better hyperparameter tuning could have improved their results.

### Personal Notes

- This is almost the core of our work. Everything is relevant.
- Even the library (TensorFlow) is relevant. We'll use it to implement our model.
- The only thing that is not relevant is the dataset. We'll use a different dataset and compare results of all production and all consumption sources.
- We might need to read the entire paper later.
